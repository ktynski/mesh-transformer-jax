Idea Title: Traveling to Avoid Trump  Idea Description: Using this data set (somewhere in here: http://tinet.ita.doc.gov/outreachpages/inbound.general_information.inbound_overview.asp) lets look at travel habits to the U.S. after Trump has been elected. Has travel fallen off? From which countries in particular? And the reverse--where are people from red states in the U.S. going? My guess is theyre not going on as many internal trips as blue states. Lets map it.  <|endoftext|>
