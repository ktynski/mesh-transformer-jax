"Idea Title: Would You Say Yes To This Ring?  Idea Description: Some girls are incredibly vain about the type of engagement ring they are given, while some dont care at all. Lets show women pictures of typical and atypical engagement rings and have them rate them/see if they would say yes to a proposal JUST based on the ring. Can include alternative stones, rings with no stone, rings with tiny/massive stones, cultural rings (claddagh from Ireland is a traditional engagement/wedding ring) things like that.  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Does Good Sex Get Better?  Idea Description: Say you have great sex with your partner already: do you believe it gets even better? What are some things we think has room for improvement? What are some things we think we could do better and our partner could do better, from blow jobs to more dirty talk? Does it get better than an orgasm and for couples who believe it, is the next step more orgasms? Longer sex? More spontaneous sex? Or are people content with both partners having an orgasm?  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Right side or wrong side?  Idea Description: Having recently traveled broad, I realized I had no idea which countries drive on the right side or the left. I was also hit and miss about which countries use the Euro versus which ones (namely England and Scotland) still use the pound. Lets test Americans on whether they know which countries use miles or meters, which drive on the left versus the right, and other things that are different depending on the area of the world youre inhabiting.  <|endoftext|>"
Idea Title: Sleep and Socializing  Idea Description: Let ask people about how sleep tends to affect they way they socialize. How does quantity and quality of sleep affect people wanting to talk with others? Introvertedness/extrovertedness? Quietness/outgoingness? Their moodiness? Their sensitivity to what other people say? Theyre wanting to say positive/negative things to other people? How are their family and friend relationships affected when they have a great/horrible night of sleep?  <|endoftext|>
Idea Title: Speed Traps Across America  Idea Description: ** This is a re-boot from a project I found in the tracker from Jan. 2016 https://www.cheapcarinsurance.net/tracking-speed-traps/ (DF/Pick-ups = 32/116) **For this idea we would tap into https://www.speedtrap.org/ and map out speed traps per city and state across America (and possibly Canada). Wed create regional rankings of cities and states along with text analysis on any additional data to determine placement of the speed trap and more.  <|endoftext|>
"Idea Title: Sports Perceptions  Idea Description: Everyone has opinions about their favorite sport, but they have even stronger opinions about the sports they dont like. So how do NFL fans feel about hockey? and (Real) Football fans feel about baseball? And how in the hell does everyone feel about rugby, because that is something else? For this wed survey diehard fans of various sports and see how they feel about the other athletics out there, and do they really know how the sport is played?  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Confessions of Fit People  Idea Description: For this campaign, we will focus on survey only people who consider them super fit (we would work with promo to find out how we want to do DQs, like maybe only people with a six pack or can lift a certain amount.) We would ask them various questions about their life to find out how they maintain their physique. Do they work out on vacations? How many days do they work out a week? How often do they have cheat meals? Do they track their macros?  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Championship Hangovers  Idea Description: Often times in the sports world, teams that win the championship in their league experience a steep drop off in quality of play the following year. Most recently the Cubs and Eagles experienced this hangover effect. This project would look into how common this effect actually is, and the teams that have been most and least affected over the years. Should be a pretty simple campaign to execute by pulling records and champions over the years.  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: r/DIY  Idea Description: using the subreddit r/DIY we can scrape the home improvement flair posts and see what types of projects are being posted the most often, many of them specify about how much money it cost them as well. We could expand this to r/DIY as a whole and see what the most popular project categories are, and see if certain projects are posted the most (ie deck building, clock making, custom gifts, etc) and what projects overall tend to score the highest.  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: A Nation of Immigrants  Idea Description: Perhaps as a companion piece to the idea above, or even as a standalone, this project would explore Ancestry in America. Broken down by MSA, lets look at the ancestry of Americans using Census data to answer questions like: What metropolitan areas have the most diverse people, based on their ancestry? What ancestral themes are there across metropolitan areas, for instance are eastern Europeans primarily centered in a specific region of the US?  <|endoftext|>"
