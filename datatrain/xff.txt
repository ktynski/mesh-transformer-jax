"Idea Title: Student Discount, Never Discontinued  Idea Description: At your college graduation, they dont shred your student ID as you walk off the stage. And your student email lives on indefinitely (depending on the college). Because of these two factors, you can theoretically take advantage of discounts and deals that are officially reserved for current students. For example, you can get 25% off a ticket for a fancy art show in Miami by just flashing them your student ID, despite you graduating six months earlier. For this campaign, lets survey college graduates across America about whether or not they still take advantage of these student discounts post-graduation.  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Best & Worst Artist Collabs  Idea Description: For the longest time people have been waiting for the collab album with Kendrick and JCole. However, they are both lyrical masterminds but are they actually the perfect collab? For this particular project we can gather interviews from various artists and use their speech to get an analysis of their personalities. With this we can group artists to see who will have the best and worst collaborations based on their personality. If these artists have already collabed on an album or song, how successful was it? This project can predict what the best and worst artist personality collaborations in 2019.  <|endoftext|>"

"Idea Title: Snake Oil Sex Pills [Repitch]  Idea Description: Men can sometimes feel pressured to perform masculinity as a way to prove themselves to other people. Viagra for ED is one thing, but erection enhancement supplements are a dangerous but pervasive option for men wanting to impress their partner. It 's easy to see why someone would be drawn to simply pop a pill and suddenly have a higher libido and stronger/longer-lasting erection, but these pills are often placebo at best, and harmful at worst. Let 's compare ingredients of the most popular supplements and see how useful they really are. Are the ingredients toxic, harmless, or scientifically effective?  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Rent Affordability by geo  Idea Description: Using a combination of Zillow data, the census, a quick survey and the MIT living wage calculator, we can find out how many people can or cannot realistically afford rent in their area. We can scrape zillow data to find the avg/median rent for a certain area (zipcode preferred, county if not) Then use the Census to show the median/avg income for those same areas (if we don 't want to run the quick survey, realistically we can do either) and use the county data from the MIT calculator to add some details as to exactly how much certain things cost in each area, and what is considered a living wage there  <|endoftext|>"
Idea Title: Richest Music Artist Living (or from) in Your State  Idea Description: For this idea we would create a map showing the top artist based on wealth from each state. We would tap into the Hot 100 and research where each artist is from. Who is the richest artist in each state? 'Ai Who is the top hop hop artist? What about all time artist? 'Ai We would go a little further and research the home state of the Hot 100 each year. Do certain cities/states usually raise top artists? Has there been a shift to artists from the South over the last decade? We could create a GIF asset that shows the breakdown of Hot 100 artists and where they come from over the course of a decade or more...  <|endoftext|>

How important do people of different generations think good posture is? Is it rude to slump at a dinner table? What %of Gen Z is already reporting back or neck pain on the regular? How many young people are already going to the chiropractor for back or neck problems, and how much did it cost them?  <|endoftext|>"

"Idea Title: Strike Zone Changes  Idea Description: https://www.brooksbaseball.net/pfxVB/pfx.php?s_type=2&sp_type=1&year=2021&month=7&day=11&batterX=&pitchSel=448179&game=633270&prevGaUsing the dataset above, we can analyze how the size of the strike zone has changed over time and how inconsistent umpire calls have been with time. There is loads of data for each pitcher, team, game, etc., so we can run a scrape to see each games strike count vs. ball count, which pitcher throws the most strikes, what % of strikes arent called correctly, etc. There have been loads of analytics on before 2015 on strike zone data, so we can take a look at 2010 to 2020.  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Cost Of Doing Business in Each State  Idea Description: Starting a business inst simple and cost vary greatly by geo. We would like to explore the total cost of starting to two types of businesses, a clothing/shoe store, and food store (cakes, pizza,etc..), then look at startup cost in 10 major cities. What is the average rent for a business in a popular area of the city? What does a biz license cost in that state (if they were forced to register their LLC there)? What are average construction costs in that city? (https://proest.com/commercial-construction-cost-index-by-state/) Average industry wages paid in that city, etc.. Similar to these types of maps:  <|endoftext|>"
