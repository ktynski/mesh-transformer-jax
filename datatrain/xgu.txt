Title have been routinely pumped out over the past 3 decades, with the first release in 1992 and latest release in 2019. Inevitably, character skins and abilities have drastically changed over time.

"Idea Title: Electric Truck Wars  Idea Description: Cybertruck, Electric F-150, Rivians truck, Hummer EV. This year will be a battle of the EV trucks, but how do people feel about the current lineup? Which ones are most in demand by survey data, by google trends data, by preorders? Which one do survey participants think is the coolest looking? Has the most clout to convey? Is the most practical/useful? Best deal? Most coveted? Etc. Project should be a mix of survey and datasets that reflect popularity of the cars (social scrape, google trends, news stories+sentiment)  <|endoftext|>"

"Idea Title: The Fun of Car Shopping  Idea Description: When car shopping how many cars/brands/insurance agencies do you look at before purchasing a car?

How many cars and brands do they go through to find the right one? How many insurance agencies do they get a quote from or do they stick with their current insurer? How do the price ranges for cars differ for generations? How many people pay cash? Lets find out  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Disability & Representation on TV  Idea Description: In recent years, there has been a growing awareness about the need for representation in media of everyday people from multiple walks of life. Women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ characters in leading roles can be seen somewhat more frequently than before, but what about people with disabilities?Lets do our own analysis of current, primetime major-network shows versus maybe Netflix or Hulu originals. Which network has the most representation? Who still has work to do? How much screentime does each character get?  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Where Dont You Feel Safe  Idea Description: This would be pretty general, but seems like low hanging fruit. Lets ask Americans a variety of demographic questions and ask them about locations a situations they feel safe or not in. How do peoples answers change based on gender, race, religion, etc. Some of the responses may expected, but it would be great to get proof of certain fears. Do more women feel unsafe in a parking lot at night? Do Muslims feel less safe now when they go to airports? We could use MTurks quotas to make sure we get adequate sample size.  <|endoftext|>"
Idea Title: Text analysis of Reddit: Cops Behaving poorly  Idea Description: Using this subreddit:https://www.reddit.com/r/copwatch/ lets analyze the posts and comments talking about police. What is the typical sentiment of these posts?What are people witnessing? Where are they coming from? are they offering up details on who they are or the cop is? Do they mention locations.?We could then offer up a supplemental survey to get peoples reactions to these sorts of behaviors and see what they think and if it is real or if they have ever witnessed this sort of thing. DO people trust cops?  <|endoftext|>
Idea Title: What safety steps do you take when ridesharing  Idea Description: What do people do to make sure they are being safe when using ridesharing services? How many people dont check the license plate? What time of night or day are people using these services? Who sits in the front? what about directly behind the driver. Do people talk to their driver? Do they share their location with the uber route? Do people speak up when their driver goes off the route in the directions? or do they wait? to keep this positive towards rideshares this campaign would focus on what riders do to stay safe  <|endoftext|>
"Idea Title: Beauty Sleep  Idea Description: In college I would fall asleep with all my makeup on, now I won 't go to bed until I complete my 5-step routine and turn on my humidifier (no one likes dry skin). For this study we\d examine the night time beauty rituals of women (and men?) to see if they\re really that worthwhile and if they lead to better rest. Do people who splash water report lower sleep than those who take their time to cleanse, tone and moisturize? We could also look at how people 's sleep quality has changed as their beauty routine has.  <|endoftext|>"
