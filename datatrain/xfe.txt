"Idea Title: Cities with the best public transportation  Idea Description: This study compares cities by evaluating their public transportation. Using data found on the transportation websites of the 100 biggest cities in America we can use a variety of factors to determine which city has the best public transportation. Factors that could be compared across systems include: fares, the number of routes and stations, or the different modes of transportation offered (ie buses v. subways or light rails that dont compete with traffic). For an extra level of comparison we could analyze Yelp reviews for the different systems to see the average rating and look for trends in the reviews.  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Would You Rather Scenarios--Extreme Tiny Living  Idea Description: Im reading an article on a family of six living in a 248 square foot bus and claiming to live their best life. Sure. But, it got me thinking about interesting would you rather scenarios in regards to these tiny home enthusiasts. Would you be willing to live in 300 square feet for five years if it meant you wouldnt have to pay for internet that whole time? What about living in 500 square feet with two kids for every year they were in school if it meant their college tuition would be paid for at the school of their choosing? I think we could get some interesting results with these types of propositions.  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Do You Know What Your Car Is Telling You?  Idea Description: Ill be the first to admit that if a light comes on my cars dashboard, I usually dont know what it represents. So Ill get out my manual to decode the issue or Ill just ignore it...How many other people are like me? How many drivers have little to no knowledge of what their car is trying to tell them? Lets give a quiz of the universal light symbols and see what people think they mean. Are men more likely to be right than women? What about millennials vs. boomers? How many people say they have lights on currently that they are ignoring? We could break this down by car make and model, too, and state.  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Teeth in your Older Age  Idea Description: Whenever I read Reddit threads centered around advice older people wish they knew when they were younger, leading advice always centers around wishing they took better care of their teeth when they were younger. People generally end up spending a ton of money when theyre older to deal with dental issues stemming from improper hygiene in their youth. Lets quantify this. Lets survey people above the age of X and question them about pain levels they experience due to dental stuff, how much money theyve spent on repairs, how many more money they need to spend on repairs, number of teeth theyve lost, ect.  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Wheres my package?  Idea Description: In recent years, the number of cases of Americans having their package stolen from their front porch or mailbox has increased. It has become very common to read or see footage on the news about Porch Pirates stealing from doorsteps around the country. Have you ever been a victim of package theft from your porch? How common is package theft? For this campaign lets survey people on how much they trust theyll get what they ordered when buying online, their experiences receiving their orders and if they have been victims of package theft. We could breakdown these findings by gender and generation.  <|endoftext|>"
Idea Title: Nursing Home Fire Safety In America  Idea Description: We did https://www.care.com/c/stories/15840/nursing-homes-in-america/ <--- This study last year and it did well with regional data. If we can compose something similar with best/worst nursing homes for fire safety and pair it with a survey asking caretakers about their expectations of nursing home safety; I think it would do well Data Set: https://data.medicare.gov/Nursing-Home-Compare/Fire-Safety-Deficiencies/ifjz-ge4wNewsworthiness: https://health.usnews.com/health-news/best-nursing-homes/articles/nursing-home-facts-and-statisticsI would like to discuss and refine questions with a creative :)  <|endoftext|>
"Idea Title: Deadliest Infrastructure Failures  Idea Description: Using MediaCloud or Campground, lets scrape news headlines over the past two decades (if possible) that contain phrases related to building collapses. With this data, we can identify which states, cities, and countries have had the deadliest infrastructure failures. We can likely infer the safest as well. Whats more, we can supplement this scrape with building code data (https://ibhs.org/public-policy/building-codes-by-state/#ut) to identify which states have the strongest code. Im envisioning some unique visuals and possibly an interactive to hype the client up (if its in our best interest, of course)  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Tornado Zones in America Since 1950  Idea Description: Using an NOAA database of tornadoes, we can see what tornadoes were the deadliest of all time, as well as map individual tornadoes and their impact on human life. This dataset provides fatalities, injuries, and magnitude of tornadoes and goes back to the 1950s, and would allow us to map tornadoes over time Are these types of weather events increasing, and where? Are there states that are starting to experience tornadoes more so in the last 20, 10 years than before in their history? We can also cross this data with locations of metropolitan areas to see which are happening in more heavily populated areas.  <|endoftext|>"
Idea Title: Data Breaches  Idea Description: Data breaches happen and if consumers are lucky they get to hear about the big ones. Business Insider: https://www.businessinsider.com/data-breaches-2018-4#gamestop-15 published recent 2018 data breaches and the list includes some trusted names like Macys. Lets survey consumers and ask about which data breaches theyve heard about recently? How did it effect their buying habits in those locations? Do they use their credit card less online? Has it prompted them to switch to Apple Pay for security? Would it help build their trust if that business invested in better data tracking software? Why or why not?  <|endoftext|>
"Idea Title: Homeowners Coverage  Idea Description: The California Wildfires are reshaping fire insurance for homeowners. More than 7,000 structures have been destroyed as wildfires continue to rip through California. How many homeowners actually have insurance for their home and which coverage is the most important? Most people who live in flood zones know and accept the risks associated with their location. But what about the people who live just outside flood zones, or those who arent aware that they live just outside one? What are the optional insurances people are more willing to purchase? https://www.allstate.com/home-insurance/your-situation.aspx  <|endoftext|>"
