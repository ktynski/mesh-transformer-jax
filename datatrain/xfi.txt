"Idea Title: Auto-filling Credit Card Info  Idea Description: Chrome and other browsers can save your credit card information for you so that you can auto-fill without having to look it up. It can then be used on everything from Amazon orders to Dominoes. Lets dig into how people are using this function.How many people use this? How often? How does that compare to how often they physically input the card number? On average, how many sites do they do it for? What type of sites? Have they ever used it on public wifi? Do people think that it puts their credit card information at more risk of being stolen? How many people have their partners CC info saved?  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Phone Habits While on the Road  Idea Description: We all know texting and driving is bad. But as it 's become easier to connect your phone to your car, how much are people heeding the warnings? Does hands free really make you safer than if you\re texting directly on your phone?Let 's survey people about all the ways they connect/use their phones with their cars. Do you do voice-to-text? Do they connect Bluetooth to listen to music/podcasts? Are these features ACTUALLY hands-free? Do drivers admit that they\re still distracted? Has anyone been in an accident because of phone use while driving (could back this up with a data source, maybe)?  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Workplace Injuries: Armed Forces vs Civilian Careers  Idea Description: For this campaign, well compare the likelihood of getting injured in the armed forces and in various civilian careers. While many military occupations are inherently dangerous, there are also plenty of safe, non-combat roles that a majority of our armed forces perform. So, the results might be surprising.Which jobs are more dangerous than the military, and how do they compare? How do injuries and fatalities in the military compare to in the civilian sector overall.Fatal injuries: https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshcfoi1.htm#2018Non-fatal: https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshsum.htm#18Summary_News_Release  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Important Home Inspections  Idea Description: Inspecting the critical structures of your home is essential for making sure your family is safe, but how often do people do this? Using a survey, lets ask homeowners how often they check air filters, inspect roofing, foundations, alarms, plumbing pipes, chimneys and more. We could also ask if theyre noticing any issues. Failing to do some of these checks can really cause problems from fires to reduced energy efficiency. This would show us the most and least responsible homeowners and would be a a very educational piece if we include expert info on how often these tasks should actually be done.  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Borrowing in Life  Idea Description: What are you comfortable borrowing from others? A DVD? a shirt, or a pair of shoes? What about money? How much money do you feel comfortable borrowing from a friend, or a family member, vs taking out a personal loan? Why would/wouldnt people feel comfortable borrowing from the one over the other? Who feels more comfortable borrowing from friends/family than taking out a loan? Who feels most comfortable with the opposite situation? How often did people borrow money in each stage of life? (teen to young adult to adult) Do they feel comfortable with how much theyve borrowed in their lives?  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Private or Public?  Idea Description: Let survey people about their motivations, behaviors, and concerns with making their social media accounts public and/or private. How many people change this based on their employment status? How about people changing it based on if theyre in a relationship vs. if theyre single and looking? If their accounts are public, are there any specific measures they still take to hide information (untagging locations, untagging people, etc.)? How do generations and genders differ in this? How many people really couldnt care less about their personal info being available for any and everyone to see?  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Profiting off of Disaster  Idea Description: To say the stock market has tanked in recent days is a 1929 level understatement. People are selling like their stocks are on fire, and prices per share are plummeting. All the better to buy them up.Lets survey Americans and Australians who own/recently owned stocks. How many have cleaned house during the present catastrophe? How many have done the inverse? How many people are buying up cheap stocks to sit on until this all blows over? Who, in terms of age, education, income, and job level, is doing that? What types of stocks are the selling/buying in terms of both industry and level of risk?  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Weight Loss Outlets  Idea Description: Dataset: https://nhis.ipums.org/nhis-action/variables/live_searchThis iPUMS health survey data set has a lot of variables regarding the height, weight, and bmi of respondents. I think it would be very interesting to focus in on those respondents who are overweight or near overweight and see what they have been doing in order to help themselves. There are a lot of variables that seem interesting, include Amount of weight change during 2+ weeks sad/blue/depressed, past 12 months, Used prayer for: Weight problem, 'tNow trying to change weight, etc. There are at least 80 variables like that.  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Pregame Behaviors: Drugs and Alcohol  Idea Description: The campaign Perceptions of Pregaming did extremely well for Recovery bands, and so did another campaign that looked at occasions we drink at most. Using this concept, lets just look at the consumption of alcohol and drugs before X activity or event. I think looking at what drugs are combined with the consumption of alcohol most pushes the envelope a bit. Well measure what a typical pregame is: time and drinks, what amounts of pregaming for X event, and on top of alcohol, what drugs people are also taking. Is anyone doing cocaine before a date? Smoking weed before a movie, a work event, etc...?  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Sources of Work Motivation  Idea Description: For this campaign, lets look into what motivates people at work. We know the paycheck every two weeks is more than enough to get people at their desks day in and day out, but what other motivators push people to work hard and excel at their jobs?We would ask people about different motivators -- money, engaging work, job security, a fun work environment -- and ask them which they personally find most motivating. Are specific motivators tied to performance? i.e. are the people who are motivated by more than money better at their jobs, more productive, in higher job positions, make more money?  <|endoftext|>"
