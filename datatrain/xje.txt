"Idea Title: Generational Gaps in Pop Culture  Idea Description: Pew research did a study on the generation gap in politics a while back (http://www.people-press.org/2011/11/03/the-generation-gap-and-the-2012-election-3/)We could do something less serious and examine the generation gap in pop culture (or something along those lines).

Idea Title: Open Source  Idea Description: Open source is a very important concept that devs take seriously as it brings us all together in a technological space.
