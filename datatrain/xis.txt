"Idea Title: Survey of Internet Rights  Idea Description: Similar to this recent report: https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/freedom-net-2018, I\d like to take a look at how free people feel they are with regards to their usage of the internet - perhaps with an international survey. Do people consider internet access to be a right or a privilege? Where would it rank in accordance with other rights granted to them? Do certain people 's place more value on it than others?  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: College Education Around The World  Idea Description: In the US we pick out college, our major and what we do with that after, but thats not the case for many places around the world. In Denmark your education is covered by the company you will work for after and theres little flexibility during your education. For this study we survey college grads from the US, Europe (UK or comparable) and AU to compare education paths, funding and if they think the outcome was worth it.  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Theyll Cure That Before I Have to Worry  Idea Description: On the verge, as we are, of what seems like it will inevitably be another technological revolution, how many people aren 't taking care of themselves as well as they should because they expect the future of medicine to be so advanced that they don 't have to worry? Don 't smoke cigarettes. Why not? They\re already starting to print organs. You should exercise. Why? They 'll have a pill for that in the next decade.  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: The Effects of a Bedtime  Idea Description: When I was younger, my bedtime was very strictly enforced. However, my sleep schedule hasnt been as regular since? How many people had a bedtime when they were younger? How many still keep the habit? Are there any significant differences between those who had a bedtime and those who didnt? Are they more satisfied with their quality of sleep/duration? Are they more productive/successful/financially well off?  <|endoftext|>"
Idea Title: Finally Free  Idea Description: Debt is like a rain cloud over your boat. Its no fun and it truly has the ability to impede you from living your life the way you want. For this campaign we can survey those that are have had debt but now debt free to see how their lifestyle has changed for the better. What do they have the ability to do now that they didnt before? How has their outlook on life changed? How long did it take them to pay off their debt?  <|endoftext|>
"Idea Title: Size and Happiness  Idea Description: Is bigger always better? Maybe when it comes to one night stands, but what about for the long haul? In general, are women who date men with bigger members happier in their relationships? What about men dating men? Do they worry about their partner cheating on them more than the average person? Same goes for boobs and butt, do men who date girls with bigger boobs feel happier in the long run? What about girls dating girls?  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Car costs: lease or buy?  Idea Description: We can compare the cost of a car, including how much maintenance it will cost for that car in a year and average cost of fuel a year, for different car categories: suv, minivan, hybrid, sedan, etc..... which ones are the most economical and moreover is buying the car up front saving you more than if you lease it? maybe we can even list the top 5 most popular cars in each of those categories and get brand and model specific  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Safest and Dangerous States for the Elderly (crime)  Idea Description: Lets examine where elderly crime is increasing around the country. Using https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/api we can pull location information by age to show the most dangerous and safest states for the elderly. This will have plenty of regional information to pitch. https://www.seniorliving.org/research/where-the-healthiest-seniors-roam/ is one of the highest performing campaigns, and this could follow suit.  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Lease vs. Own  Idea Description: The whole lease vs. own argument with cars seems to be something people have very strong feelings about, one way or another. Lets survey people about which they ultimately feels is better and why. Have people gotten burned before by a lease that comes with a big bill at the end of the term? Do people prefer being able to get a new car every few years? How many people have only leased cars, only owned cars, and done both?  <|endoftext|>"
Idea Title: Missed a Dose? What do you do?  Idea Description: Every medication is different if you miss a dose. This would be a survey trying to understand what people do when they miss a dose. Do they know what the proper protocol is for their specific med? All meds they take? Only some? Are there some who are knowingly doing it wrong? Can they check now and see if they are wrong? Have they ever had a negative outcome from doing this improperly? Which demographics do it most? Least?  <|endoftext|>
