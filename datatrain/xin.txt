Idea Title: Stuck in the 90s  Idea Description: Let 's face it: the 90s were just a better time. And 90s kids spend a lot of time explaining how much better things were back in the day' so let 's find out which elements trigger their nostalgia the most. Is it hearing I Want It That Way come on the radio that sends 90s babies scrambling to YouTube for their fix? A Spongebob marathon? Seeing Lunchables at the grocery store? We 'll discover what these people are missing the most.  <|endoftext|>
"Idea Title: Credit Health and Happiness  Idea Description: Lets do a campaign all about credit and credit scores. Well survey people, ask their credit scores, and see how happy/miserable they are, how credit has impacted them, horror stories (how many people have gotten denied, how many people actively hav tried to fix their credit), etc. Will include a quiz section, and IG about what goes into your credit score, guidelines and best practices to follow, and a survey execution. Include HARO  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Shotgun Rules  Idea Description: Silly idea, but lets run a survey about shotgun rules, etiquitte, and expand the project by folding these into a larger story about road trips, driver and passenger etiquitte. We could include a bunch of fun stories about crazy sutff thats happened on the road, and find out all things manners-wise as they related to traveling in a car with another person (chip in for gas? trade off? longest anyones driven? how long before you fly?)  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Euro 2021 - Predictions  Idea Description: For this campaign, we could target European soccer fans to ask them about their outlook and predictions for the Euros coming up this summer.Which team do they believe has the best chance to win, and who will be eliminated early? Will Germany make it out of the Group stage after disappointing world cup? Can France win the tournament? And who should be a part of the England squad, with too many good players available to be called up?  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Whats a Trade Deficit?  Idea Description: The President is well known for making, lets say creative statements that arent exactly true. Money CNN went on record and cleared that we do not in fact have a trade deficit with Canada but how many people believed it? Similar to past project lets focus on financial related statements that the president has made within the past year and then survey people and ask if they know what they mean, if they believe them to be true, etc.  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: How Dangerous Are Your Home hazards  Idea Description: Everyone knows to clean out the lint trap to avoid a fire but how many people let their smoke detector run out of batteries? In this campaign, we would survey people and ask them to rank the danger of common home hazards. Do people think exposed electrical wires are worse than mold? Do people let more urgent matters linger because its not interrupting their day to day? We could also compare the survey results to actual statistics.  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: United States of Talent  Idea Description: Which cities/states produce the best talent today? While cities like Memphis are known for their musical roots, lets look at current billboard data to see where artists are stemming from these days. For example, theres an influx of Florida rappers on the scene. Would be cool to segment where artists come from regionally and whether theres correlations with different genres (Florida = rappers, Tennessee = country stars, etc).  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Happiness at Work  Idea Description: I recently spotted an article on The Motley Fool that stated only 40% of workers are happy at their job. Lets survey 1,000 people about their happiness at their job and analyze the data to determine the happiest industries/company sizes/states/ etc. Additionally, lets ask them to rate different work perks (wfh, pto, paternity leave, etc.) to determine which simple benefits employers could offer to improve their workplace.  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Miami as the next Tech Hub - By The Numbers  Idea Description: This would be an analysis of non-traditional and up and coming tech hubs we would use a variety of data sources and survey to tell this story. We would try to understand the growth of individual cities (or maybe focus on just one like Miami), and see how they are trending in new businesses, venture capital money, news stories, search mentions, twitter etc. Which are the talk of the town?Which are growing most? Which is the future?  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Gen Z, who?  Idea Description: A recent article about Gen Z entering the workforce BLEW UP: https://www.inc.com/suzanne-lucas/gen-z-is-coming-to-workforce-here-is-what-to-expect.html but really its not based in a whole lot of data. Lets do this better by surveying current college students (it can be done, and gen z starts with those born in the mid 90s) and asking them about their career expectations, work perks important to them, and overall professionalism.  <|endoftext|>"
