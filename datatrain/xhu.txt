"Idea Title: Falling Asleep Where You Shouldnt Have  Idea Description: Falling asleep when you shouldnt could be either very embarrassing or very dangerous. This would be a survey trying to understand all the variety of places and circumstances people have fallen asleep inappropriately. In class, during church, at a funeral or wedding, driving, at work, at work doing a dangerous job, etc. etc. We would also be looking at the consequences of this as well as the demographic differences we would see on who is most likely to have done this.  <|endoftext|>"

For this campaign lets find women that have taken the first move in their relationship.

How many think the concept would work well for their exercise and health goals? How many have done something like it? Average pounds lost? Average money lost and or gained?

"Idea Title: A Day of Fatal Car Accidents in America  Idea Description: This is a little different from our normal campaigns as I envision this as a one asset piece. We could get FARS data from the most recent year and divide the numbers by 365 days. We would use location data and time of day data to slowly populate crashes over a map over the course of a single day. We could color the crashes based on the most promotional breakdowns promo deems fit. Then emphasize somehow with how full the map is at the end, that this is only a single day.  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: 10 x contentHome Fire Risk Interactive  Idea Description: Using FEMA data, and home data (Zillow or others), we could create an interactive that used data points from FEMA around home age, home location, home construction type (wood,brick,etc). We could use this to create some kind of risk score for people, and recommendations for improving their risk profile. https://www.nfpa.org/-/media/Files/News-and-Research/Fire-statistics-and-reports/Building-and-life-safety/oshomes.pdf, https://home-fire-risk.github.io/smoke_alarm_map/  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Drawing Climate Change  Idea Description: For this idea we would display a map of the world for people (or possibly just America) and ask them to draw/fill-in, with a blue marker style tool, where they think climate change will affect the map over a variety of years... In 10, 20, 30, or 50+ years down the line, how far in-land do people think sea level rise will affect? We could layer the results to make an average over the years, as well as segment results by other demos, like political affiliation, etc..  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Beyonce vs...  Idea Description: The Beyhive is serious. But does Beyonce beat out some of historys greatest! Lets put Beyonce up against some of the greats and see. Beyonce vs. Gaga, Rihanna, Aretha, Whitney, etc. **Wed have to be careful here to not be racially incentive (for example, pitting republican women vs. democratic women etc)... For good reason, artists and black publications do not like when majority white institutions criticize artists of color given the history of music and allldat.  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: How much regulation is too much?  Idea Description: Facebook, Twitter, and any other online platform are protected by Section 230, which relieves platforms of responsibility over what their users do on the platform. However, lawyers and Washington are questioning and litigating the law more than ever since its birth 20 or so years ago. Lets see how much regulation people are willing to have online, how much if its in the name of preventing atrocities like human trafficking, how much to prevent fake advertising, etc.  <|endoftext|>"
Idea Title: Musical Progression Over Time  Idea Description: You miss the old Kanye. Join the club. But what exactly are we talking about when we say this? Lets quantify this nostalgia with a sound analysis software and explore how the musical elements of trending artists discographies have changed over time. We can look at their lyrics and see how their use of language has evolved over time. Is Kanye using less metaphors and word play than he once did? Is there increased use of repetition and speaking inserts into his music?  <|endoftext|>
Idea Title: Work to Live; Live to Work  Idea Description: Lets survey U.S. and U.K. residents about their work/life balance. How many days off do the UK respondents think is appropriate for vacation? What about the U.S.? How many days did each group take off the past year? How long was their average trip? We could expand it to ask what do you value more--time or money? I think we could get some really interesting results to show that Americans are very much live to work while our European counterparts are work to live.  <|endoftext|>
