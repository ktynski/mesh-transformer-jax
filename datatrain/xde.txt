"Idea Title: The Biggest Cities Without  Idea Description: During the recent Amazon HQ hubbub, cities seemed to bend over backwards in order to entice the worlds richest man to come to their city by offering tax breaks and a whole bunch of other incentives. Amazon ultimately chose NYC and the DC area, which are already packed with Fortune 500 headquarters http://fortune.com/fortune500/visualizations/This got me thinking, in general, what are the biggest cities in America that dont have certain things (like a F500 Headquarters)? We saw this once in a campaign for CBD (the biggest city in America without a retailer of cbd was Laredo, TX), but we should be able to do this with the Yelp API for any tags they offer, i.e., whats the biggest city in America without Mexican food, or a public park, or a doctors office)  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Most/Least Productive Company Cultures/Policies  Idea Description: For this campaign, well explore how a companys culture affects employee productivity, satisfaction, and outlook. Specifically, well focus on flexibility, openness, transparency, and other related aspect.Well survey employed respondents about their employers attitudes and policies, comparing each group based on their employers characteristics.Are employees with flexible schedules actually more productive than those who are tied to a desk for specific hours? Are people more likely to appreciate their job when they can be open with their boss about why theyre really taking the day off? Does a more hand-off approach actually correlate to higher output than micromanagement? How does a CEO or VPs attitudes/outlook impact their company and employees?  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Debt-Free & Flying High  Idea Description: I recently paid off all my debt. $48K in total. It took me just a little four years and I didnt have to get a sugar daddy to do it, but I worked full-time and lots of side hustles. Im wondering, have other millennials also paid off their debt. How much did they have in total? What kind of debt was it? Credit Card. School. Car? How long did it take them? How much supplemental money did they need to make? How did they set their priorities? Did they see a financial planner? Do they regret having taken on debt? Why or why not? Are they the first of their friends to have accomplished this?

"Idea Title: Life After Divorce  Idea Description: The divorce rate in America is around 40-50% so that means a large population of baby boomers are divorced.

"Idea Title: Instagrams Middle East Travel Guide  Idea Description: What are the most instgrammable places in the middle east? I think it\d be super interesting (and on-brand) to see where people travel to the most, what locations they visit the most, and crate an instagram-based tour page showing what the most seen locations are. We could embed pictures, and show off some of the middle easts most beautiful locations. We\d scrape for #uae #oman etc for every country, then use the location data to easily see the most checked in places. WE could also run them through google vision if we wanted to for a low cost, and see results that way.I'm thinking top 10 lists, like hotels restaurants tourist destiations, and also you could do cool interactives where you can see the top x things, and pull up all the IG pics of it.  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Workout Injuries  Idea Description: No pain. No gain. It 's a mantra expressed in fitness communities and often used to rationalize why one should continue exercising through pain.Sometimes, this is fine.

What types of exercises are most associated with the development of long-lasting pain?What motivates people to ignore pain--personal desire, fear of how they 'll be perceived, pressure in a relationship, ect.  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Why Women Become Entrepreneurs  Idea Description: I saw a tweet that said something to the effect of, Women so often opt for entrepreneurship because they\re tired of the major shortcomings of the traditional workplace. The idea is that women are tired of having to fight gender stereotyping, toxic culture, and a bunch of other things, so they\d rather go build something on their own that works for them.Let 's explore this in a campaign specifically about female entrepreneurs. What inspired them to be an entrepreneur? Was it due to problems in the traditional workplace? What do they feel they do better/different in their own business than employers they worked for? What have been the pros and cons of entrepreneurship for them? How has the pandemic gone for them -- are they struggling to stay afloat?  <|endoftext|>"
