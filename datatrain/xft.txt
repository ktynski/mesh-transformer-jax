"Idea Title: Pregnancy Pains  Idea Description: Theres been a lot of recent coverage on mothers using medical marijuana to alleviate morning sickness, this of course has created quite the stir on safe this is but its gotta be super common. Survey of expecting/past mothers that have used substances from medical marijuana, cbd, supplements, etc. and why. It could be interesting to incorporate a financial aspect into this and see if theres a correlation between mothers who use marijuana and their income level/employment/health insurance/race/etc. I think the moms that are doing this have no other realistic solutions.  <|endoftext|>"
Idea Title: Until it Happens to You  Idea Description: Its easy for people to take hard-line stances or make absolute statements when they think something doesnt apply to them. Things change when it happens to you or someone you know. For this project lets survey people who arent friends or related to an addict vs. those who are or have been. Who do they blame for the addiction? To what extent do they think the government should provide more resources? What political issue is most important to them? The project would highlight how our perspective changes when we see the realities of something through someone close to us.  <|endoftext|>
"Idea Title: What Your Employer Doesnt Know  Idea Description: In the Netflix show Working Moms, I was shocked when a lead character decided to lie to her employer about being married and having kids, and that they even asked that of her on the first day. Thinking it would make her look less edgy in this hip and creative environment, she decided to pose as engaged and childless. It 's strange how work pressures make you feel like you need to keep those secrets or lie to employers. How many people keep major life details away from employees, from kids, sickness, an engagement, to having a second job, wanting to get pregnant, etc?  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Tesla vs. X - Horserace Visualization  Idea Description: Teslas, especially the performance models are incredibly fast cars. That said, there are still some gas cars that outperform them. This would be a horserace style visualization like this: http://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/08/05/sports/olympics/the-100-meter-dash-one-race-every-medalist-ever.html? (or more simplistic 2d version), that would make direct comparisons of the different speed tests for cars. 0-60, 0-120, 40-100, etc. Giving people a real feel for what the speed differences are between the Tesla and other gas, and even electric cars.  <|endoftext|>"

"Idea Title: Perceptions of Telemedicine  Idea Description: Telemedicine, or the ability to access medical advice from a doctor via phone call or video chat is the way of the future, but how do Americans feel about it? Lets survey people about whether they would use telemedical services if they were available, if they already use them now, and how effective they think they are. Does this change based on the environment you live in? i.e. rural areas that dont have many options for doctors using it more because it opens up the health spectrum to the patient? more common for millennials because we hate going to the actual doctor?  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Attractiveness by Investment  Idea Description: Youre at a bar. You see a guy/girl you think is cute. You start chatting it up, getting to know each other. And then somehow the conversation takes a turn to your investments (bear with me here). Would the other person find you less attractive if you told them that your stock portfolio is mainly composed of agricultural stocks and commodities, rather than some hotshot tech company? Does the amount you have in them make any difference? Is there a difference between what the two sexes find attractive? Do different generations care more or less what stocks you invest in?  <|endoftext|>"
