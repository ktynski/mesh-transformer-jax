"Idea Title: Being a Drug and Alcohol Sherpa  Idea Description: Who guided you through your first experience with marijuana? Shrooms? Alcohol? How many people tag a friend to be there with them when they experiment with X drug? We 'll survey people to see how many have been guided through their experiences with various drugs and alcohol. We 'll ask respondents to rate their experience on how high or drunk they got that time, what myths about blacking out, drug-specific tips or certain tricks they may have been told, and who is the best/worst sherpa for those substance experiences.  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Cocktail Quiz  Idea Description: This campaign quizzes Mturkers on their knowledge of (famous) cocktails. Lets see what percentage of people knows at least the ingredients to their favorite cocktail. And what do they think about drinking behavior: How many of each example does it take to have a hangover the next day, knock you off your chair, etc. Whats perceived to be the strongest/worst/least favorite cocktail of all times? We could embed a short quiz on the landing page so readers can take it themselves and see where they fall with their responses.  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: How Much Do You Sleep At Music Festivals  Idea Description: Drugs, Sex, Music, Tents, Sleep - in that order. Lets survey people whove been to festivals (of which on MTURK I feel their are plenty) and ask them about their experiences around those festivals, and what I think would be the most interesting would be (other than drugs) the hook-up culture and sleeping at these festivals. How many hours of sleep are people getting, how many strangers are they hooking up with, and what percent of their time are spent on drugs, because all of these actions are happening while on drugs.  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: 2018 Artist and Song Popularity (Using Wikipedia Pageview API)  Idea Description: The Pudding has done a couple of really interesting projects measuring popularity through Wikipedia pageviews. For this idea, lets leverage this comprehensive datasource to instead explore musician AND/OR song pageviews.Using this source, we can examine celebrity popularity over time, compared to each other, before/after song or album release, by country (page language) and much more.Wikipedia data executions from The Pudding:https://pudding.cool/2018/08/wiki-death/https://pudding.cool/2018/09/wiki-billboard/  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Worried Parents  Idea Description: Some parents have expressed that they have a difficult time sleeping when their son or daughter is out late at night simply because they have no idea what is/can happen. For this particular study lets survey parents to better understand how their child affects their sleep quality. We can ask them about their sleep quality as their child gets older, from years in high school, college, and early adulthood. Does sleep quality change when the child is living at home, in college, or even their own place? lets find out!!  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Long & Short Term Commitment (To Cars)  Idea Description: People generally either buy a new car, an old car or a lease, and they have their reasons for doing either but what are the reasons for not choosing the other and how often do they occur? For instance, my mother wont buy a used car because of the fear of getting a lemon - but how many people who have purchased a used car have gotten a lemon? Some people wont get a lease because of the mile limit and the quickly expensive cost if you go over it but how many people who have had a lease have gone over their mileage limit?  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Testing Team Loyalty - Logo Recognition  Idea Description: This would be a visual test of team fandom/loyalty. Each participant would be shown 4 versions of their team 's logo. One of the logos would be the real one, and the other three would be subtly altered. Perhaps a color change here, a new line there, etc. Which fans are the best at this? Could we say this is because they are more loyal? This idea is essentially the reverse of Branded in Memory, but a BIM style campaign could also work very well with the focus of just team logos. (pending this is unique enough still)  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: A Closer Look at the HMDA Database  Idea Description: Lets explore the HMDA data (https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/hmda/) to get a better understanding of the mortgage market--which states are refinancing the most? What age groups? How many home mortgages are being used for business/commercial use? Which states have the highest amount of loans? Who has the highest/lowest interest rate? Are their trends in demos in terms of loans for secondary versus primary residence? Theres a ton of data points, so its really a matter of what narrative the CS wants to take.  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Is Music Getting Dumber?  Idea Description: People often bemoan the fact that music isnt how it used to be and that lyrics are getting dumber. But is this actually the case? For this project, wed take the grammy winning album of the year and transpose the lyrics from it. Then wed do a vocabulary analysis to determine the average reading level of each album. Is our reading level really getting worse? Or is it actually trending up? We could also expand to compare reading levels of top artists in different genres. For example, is Rap actually smarter than Country?  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: WebMD > Primary Doctor  Idea Description: We all have felt off or knew something wasn 't right at some point and the first thing we do is google our symptoms. Don 't get me wrong it 's good to be informed but the information that we receive can we wrong. For this particular campaign lets ask people how often they google their symptoms and treat it themselves instead of going to your doctor. And the main reasons why they prefer to treat themselves instead of going to your actual doctor. Is it the lack of money, is it the fear of a positive test, what is it?  <|endoftext|>"
