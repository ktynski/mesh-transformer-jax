"Idea Title: Who is Pre-Gaming?  Idea Description: Prevalence of pre-gaming was a campaign that performed pretty well. We could reboot the aspects of it that did well and remove the excess and replace it with other content. For example, I would love to do a timeline of pre-gaming. What percentage of those 18-20 pregame? How about 50 year olds? Why are they pre-gaming? To save money? Because they cant legally buy alcohol? There are plenty of angles we can add, but also keep things like what events people pregame for!  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Pro Sports Sleep Deprivation  Idea Description: Using the data compiled for the campaign on Back to Backs, see which teams have to travel the fathest for games, cross time zones the most often, etc. Determine whether or not teams that cross time zones more frequently (or play immediately after crossing time zones) dont perform as well immediately after. Can do for the 4 major US sports leagues and do things like X team gained/lost the most hours due to travel, Y team played the worst after crossing time zones, etc  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: How Good (or Bad) Is Your Vocabulary?  Idea Description: Basically, we would try to find out just how good (or bad) the average persons vocabulary is.We would measure this in two ways: asking which words they use, and asking if they know what various words mean. To expand on this concept, we could also explore peoples perceptions of words and vocabulary. If using big words makes people sound X (smarter, persuasive, authoritative, pompous, arrogant) and perhaps which specific words make people come across that way.  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Drinking by Season  Idea Description: In the winter, people often eat heavier meals and gain weight they need to lose for summer. But is the same true for drinking? As the weather gets colder, football season is here and the holidays as well. Does the average american consume more during the winter months? Do they consume heavier drinks, for example light beer might be a preferred summer beverage, but in the winter it shifts to whiskey or stouts. How do our drinking habits change for the fall and winter?  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: What Pronunciations Are Worth the Most?  Idea Description: There are all sorts of stereotypes around whether dialects sound smart/dumb, rich/poor, etc, so lets test it! Based on a similar methodology to the great NYT piece on regional dialects https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/dialect-quiz-map.html, lets cherry pick words we know are going to vary highly between regions and ensure were getting a broad regional sample. We would then look at how pronuncuations correlate with income, education, or other metrics  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: DIY Injuries  Idea Description: Do you know someone who thinks they are the DIY master but actually, they shouldnt be going near the tool box at all? Lets survey Americans to find out about when they bite off more than they can chew trying to take on a home project. Have they cut themselves with a saw? Fell off a ladder? Hit their finger while holding a nail with a hammer? Sand off some skin with a floor sander? Lets find out which injuries are most common and which projects had the most injuries.  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Im a great driver!  Idea Description: Lets ask Americans if they consider themselves good drivers. Then we would also ask how many accidents they have been involved in. In general, do people who consider themselves good drivers get in more/less accidents? People with a higher number of accidents, do they still thnk theyre good drivers? What are the top excuses they give for the accident? Bad luck? Other driver not paying attention? Have they changed anything about their driving habits after an accident?  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Relationship Satisfaction of Pet people vs. Non-pet people  Idea Description: Lets survey pet people and non-pet people in relationships about their relationship satisfaction. To tie it back to sleep we can look which of the pet people let their pets sleep in bed and how that affects the relationship. This might be too far off, but the sleep team had great success in the relationship vertical but unfortunately they have done a lot around sleep and relationships. Thats why I thought if we throw in some sleep questions here, it might work?  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Drinking on the Job  Idea Description: Wed survey 1,000 working Americans to determine the top industries/jobs that have drank on the job. Potential assets:- These are the top industries that drink/have drank on the job- Top reasons theyve drank on the job (miserable, bored, work lunch, work culture, etc.)- Effects of drinking on the job (increased creativity, less productive, etc.)- Gender/demographic/regional breakdown-- does one gender/pay scale/region drink more often on the job than others?  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Checkups and Diseases  Idea Description: Using 2017 BRFSS data, we can create a profile for every state in the US. How often do people in each state go to see the doctor and get a checkup? After we ascertain this information, we can uses other CDC data to see if there is a link between doctor visits and the rate of preventable diseases. Do people who live in states that get more checkups have less disease? This may not have as many assets, but would do well both nationally and regionally with what we have.  <|endoftext|>"
