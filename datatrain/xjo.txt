"Idea Title: Letting go of the wheel  Idea Description: With the oncoming (seeming) evolution of cars to be all self driving, how do people anticipate that change going? My father in law is completely comfortable letting his car brake if he needs to, whereas I dont think that will ever feel normal. Are people excited to have self driving cars? Do we feel like theyll be safer? And how many people plan to resist as long as possible?  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Screen Time Stoppers  Idea Description: Its 2018, and we all have smart phones. Including, as I saw throughout much of my travel lately, children while their parents try and have a separate vacation. Plenty of people swear that an iPad wont raise their kids, but how does that match up with the reality of the situation? How concerned are parents about this development? Will they intervene or try something different?  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Gym Social Habits  Idea Description: A known thing among gym rats is if my head phones are in, don 't talk to me, but does everyone think that way? Do people prefer group fitness or solo fitness? Do they get mad if there 's conversation in the gym? Do they try to talk to others or meet others at the gym, or jus there to workout? We can explore what social habits people prefer in conjunction with their exercise.  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Changing Criminal Behavior on College Campuses  Idea Description: https://ope.ed.gov/campussafety/#/customdata/datafilteredAbove is an online database that tracks arrest details for all campuses in the country since around 2000, and through 2017. We will track changes in types and incidence of crimes across time and between private and public universities. They go into pretty deep detail about types of crime, so we can be pretty flexible.  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: The Emotional State of X Crypto Investors - By Crypto  Idea Description: A text analysis project of crypto communities on reddit over time. We would pull the full corpus of each subreddit, and then look at the frequency of specific words over time. Words like fuck, shit hodl moon etc. to see over a few years, what these frequencies were. This would be a detailed understanding of the emotional views and feelings of each community over time.  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: How We Choose to Pay  Idea Description: How do people choose to pay for different things like vacations, medical expenses, a night out, mid to major purchases, clothes, groceries, etc.? In what instances is paying via debit/cash a preferred (and utilized) option compared to credit or taking a loan? Why? This survey would ask people how they pay for different spending aspects of life and explore this by demographic.  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Discussing Salary With Your Friends  Idea Description: When I bring up salary with friends, some of them dont really like to discuss how much they make, or are hesitant to talk about details of their job 'Ai Perks, and more... For this idea we would survey people on their perceptions of these conversations, if they would talk about them if asked, segmented by the type of person (a friend, family, significant other, and more...).  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Shipping Out  Idea Description: Using outside data science freelancers, lets build a campaign around the huge amount of data on US Marine Travel available at https://marinecadastre.gov/ais/. The site has data for the last 10 years and we would be able to visualize traffic data, changes over time (where is busier now than 10 years before/ where has become less busy?), how does shipping change seasonally, etc?  <|endoftext|>"
"Idea Title: Sleep Temperature + Productivity  Idea Description: With never ending stories about the optimal sleep temperature, lets explore this concept a bit deeper-- how does the temperature you sleep in impact your productivity, levels of drowsiness throughout the day, and other healthy habits (this seems like a John campaign to me), but I think exploring how sleep temperature impacts more than sleep hours would be really interesting.  <|endoftext|>"
Idea Title: What/Why Are You Working Out?  Idea Description: There is a lot of misinformation and misinterpretation that occurs when it comes to working out. The goal of this campaign would be to analyze individuals that workout and understand their intentions. Are the aware of what certain exercises are? Do they know what particular movements are working out? How often do they workout? How would they describe their levels of expertise?  <|endoftext|>
